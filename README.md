This directory will contain all the scripts used to analyze the DTI data for my Honours Thesis project.

This project is aimed at examining if there is a relationship between psychopathy and white matter differences in the brain. White matter in the brain is comprised of myelin, a fatty tissue that insulates neurons. Therefore, white matter tracks are essentially the "highways" between various brain regions. By measuring integrity of these whiter matter tracts, it can help shed light into if there are structural brain differences associated with antisocial and interpersonal deficits in psychopathy.
